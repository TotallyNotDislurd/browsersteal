# BROWSER-STEALER | UTILIZES DISCORD WEBHOOKS

**FULLY WRITTEN** IN **PYTHON**

**browser passwords/credit card steal; utilizes discord's webhooks to send information directly to discord.**

**note**: this is poorly written, i required to write something in minimal time & this is what i got in return.

**note**: the browser-stealing scripts were built using other scripts found here, on github; i do not claim credit for any of that code.

# challenge:

i'm unable to run this using Python3, if you're able to create a working browsersteal & tokenlogger with their "C2" being Discord's webhook in Python3, open a request & send me the repo, i won't mind to give a star in return.

it's a shock to me, the only repository that had a functioning browser-passwords/credit card stealer embed with a discord tokenlogger was "TroubleGrabber"

i personally, was looking for something more simple & written in python. (easier to hide in other functioning applications)
